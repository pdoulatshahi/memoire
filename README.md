I will be designing a concentration memory game with French vocabulary. Users will match French words to pictures.

User Stories

1. As a user, I should be able to select from different sets of vocabulary.
2. As a user, I should be able to have the cards randomized so that if I select the same set twice, I don't already know where all the cards are the second time.
3. As a user, I should have cards removed from the available cards once I have correctly matched them.
4. As a user, I should be able to know how many cards I have remaining.
5. As a user, I should be able to see how long it takes me to successfully match all of the cards.
